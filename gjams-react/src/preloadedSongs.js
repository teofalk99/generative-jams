    lyrics:  "Run fast from my day job, runnin' fast from the way it was \
    Jump quick to a paycheck, runnin' back to the strip club \
    I'm never goin' back, never goin' back, no, you can't make me \
    Never goin' back, never goin' back (nah), they'll never take me \
    I've paid enough of petty dues, I've heard enough of sh- news \
    I had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10, love dirty men alike \
    Ooh, better day than yesterday (keep cuttin' up) \
    Ooh, I just take it day by day \
    Ooh-oh, never hearing what they say (uh) \
    Ooh-ooh (uh), I just do it my way \
    All I got is these broken clocks \
    I ain't got no time, just burnin' daylight \
    Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love \
    It's still love, still love (still love), still love \
    It's still love, but it's still love, nothin' but love for you (nothin' but) \
    Nothin' but love (nothin' but), nothin' but love \
    All that I've got, pieces and pages \
    Talkin' a lot, sorry, I'm faded (turnin' up real good tonight) \
    Think I forgot you love me (think I forgot the other night) \
    You love me, you love me \
    Got a shift at 10 a.m. (yeah), gotta dip at 10 p.m. (nah) \
    Gotta get that cash, won't get past a lunch break \
    I ain't had a smoke break in about two days, don't break (uh) \
    Been about three years since I dated you \
    Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together? \
    I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever \
    I was down for whatever and then some \
    You gon' make me late to work again \
    Ooh, better day than yesterday \
    Ooh, I just take it day by day \
    Ooh-oh, never hearing what they say \
    Ooh-ooh, I just do it my way (keep doin' it) \
    All I got is these broken clocks \
    I ain't got no time, just burnin' daylight \
    Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love \
    It's still love, still love, still love (still love) \
    It's still love, but it's still love (still love), nothin' but love for you \
    Nothin' but love (nothin' but), nothin' but love \
    I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 a.m. \
    Heartbeat make me feel young again (make me feel like a-) \
    Can't beat 'em, just join the party (let me join the party) \
    I don't wanna, don't need nobody \
    All that I've got, pieces and pages \
    Talkin' a lot, sorry, I'm faded \
    Think I forgot you love me \
    You love me, you love me \
    You love me \
    You love me \
    You love me"

    {filename:"noah_kahan.jpg", title: "Stick Season", artist: "Noah Kahan", lyrics: "As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined \
    You must have had yourself a change of heart like \
    Halfway through the drive \
    'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign \
    You kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right \
    Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face \
    And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace \
    And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains \
    Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes \
    And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks \
    And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed \
    And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim \
    I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas \
    And I'll dream each night of some version of you \
    That I might not have, but I did not lose \
    Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes \
    And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do \
    So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad \
    That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad \
    No, I am no longer funny, 'cause I miss the way you laugh \
    You once called me forever, now you still can't call me back \
    And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks \
    And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed \
    And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim \
    I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas \
    And I'll dream each night of some version of you \
    That I might not have, but I did not lose \
    Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes \
    And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do \
    Oh, that'll have to do \
    My other half was you \
    I hope this pain's just passin' through \
    But I doubt it \
    And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks \
    And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed \
    And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim \
    I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas \
    And I'll dream each night of some version of you \
    That I might not have, but I did not lose \
    Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes \
    And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do \
    Have to do"

    That you could sell for me \
    \
    What do you think my brain is made for \
    Is it just a container for the mind? \
    This great grey matter \
    Sensei replied, 'What is your woman? \
    Is she just a container for the child?' \
    That soft pink matter \
    Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh \
    Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you \
    My God, she's giving me pleasure \
    \
    What if the sky and the stars are for show \
    And the aliens are watching live \
    From the purple matter? \
    Sensei went quiet then violent \
    And we sparred until we both grew tired \
    Nothing mattered \
    Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh \
    Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you \
    My God, giving me pleasure \
    Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure \
    Pleasure over matter \
    \
    Hey, hey \
    Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals \
    You were such a habit to call \
    I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, 'Naw \
    She better with some fella with a regular job.' \
    I didn't wanna get her involved \
    By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe \
    Hopped into my car; drove far \
    Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp \
    Butter knife, what a life, anyway \
    I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway? \
    She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate \
    Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin \
    If models are made for modeling \
    Thick girls are made for cuddling \
    Switch worlds and we can huddle then \
    Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand \
    You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands \
    \
    Grey matter \
    Blue used to be my favorite color \
    Now I ain't got no choice \
    Blue matter \
    \
    You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good \
    For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey \
    You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good) \
    For heaven's sakes, go to hell \
    For heaven's sakes, go to hell \
    Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood \
    Well, frankly, when that ocean so motherfucking good \
    Make her swab the motherfucking wood \
    Make her walk the motherfucking plank \
    Make her rob a motherfucking bank \
    With no mask on and a rusty revolver"

    Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (spending addiction) \
    Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels) \
    Too many bitches, they coming in twos \

    Why the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest) \
    Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool) \

    I'm out my depression, life been going smooth \
    Bonds in my session, back end through the roof \

    Most of my classmates thought I was a joke \
    Now look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope \
    Blue Phantom, I'm like I need me one of those \
    I built my name up to help the business grow \
    She freaky, pulled up without no pantyhose \

    Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose \
    Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow \
    Locked him up, put him in a hellhole \
    They hope that he rotting out in mildew \
    Ain't seen him since my first year of high school \
    I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mill' or two \
    Ten years riding, I made sure he had some food \

    Crew full of winners, no way we can lose \
    I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss \
    Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall \
    I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws \
    I'm getting that money, money over all \
    If broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it \
    If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga \
    Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog (frog) \
    Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter \
    Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (tall) \
